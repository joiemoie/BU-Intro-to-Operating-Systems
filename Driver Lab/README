The following adder was created based on a template of chardev.

It sets the major to 200 using register_chrdev and assigns certain file operations such as open, close, read and write.

In this implementation, it reads character by character. Whenever the read call
encounters whitespace, it parses the string and turns it into a number. The number is added to the running sum.
The way to check for a single reader and writer is using two boolean flags. These flags are set to one at the beginning
of a read/write call then zero at the end of the function. IF another reader/writer tries to read/write, it returns an error code.
